In today's age of modern technology, many business owners often ask, "What does an IT managed service team do?" IT services play an integral role in modern business. Today, it is almost unthinkable to venture into contemporary services without IT support and infrastructure. The goal is to achieve a well-managed IT infrastructure with expert staff focusing on their respective fields—but this is easier said than done. The world of IT remains a highly sought-after and expanding industry, yet frequently, there is insufficient supply. Alternatively, businesses may lack the funds to hire dedicated IT staff.

Engage in managed services or use a managed service provider. In today's competitive environment, they are crucial for many businesses, helping them stay competitive when they do not have all the necessary resources.

## What are IT Managed Services?

Managed services are third parties—typically an MSP (managed service provider)—that provide crucial business operations and infrastructure to businesses of varying sizes. These are IT services for infrastructure. Depending on the organization's requirements, they cover communication solutions and full outsourced IT support. Access security, [cybersecurity](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices), network setups, support, and backup recovery fall under the services provided by an MSP.

### Outsourced IT Helpdesk Support

Does your staff need immediate support? Using an IT helpdesk is the answer. IT service companies can offer a group of IT specialists to solve problems when needed. Using a remote support desk instead of forming your team has several advantages: reduced operational expenses, qualified IT professionals, better efficiency, and assurance that your systems are repaired properly. Your managed service provider is always a call away for support services anytime!

### Onsite IT support

When you engage an IT managed service provider, they can send an IT technician to your office as per your service level agreement when you face IT problems. This is a big advantage for small and medium-sized businesses, whether they are large or small. We understand that not all issues can be solved remotely. Having the appropriate IT experts who know your IT setup well will greatly minimize downtime.

### Cyber Security

IT managed service providers can offer your company complete cybersecurity solutions. Depending on your industry, regulatory needs, and IT objectives, your managed services provider can design a cybersecurity strategy that suits your company. Many IT firms can offer your company-managed firewall services, antivirus/EDR, and SOC. Your team for managed services can design a personalized package of managed security services to tackle your particular concerns about cybersecurity.

### Network Monitoring

Your IT managed service provider will actively monitor your network and utilize tools to monitor networks remotely to give updates on the condition of your IT setup. Having a managed IT service team that offers real-time monitoring and reporting will lower the amount of time your systems are not operational since the team gets instant notifications to start fixing any network problems.

### Patch Management

Isn't updating and fixing all your company systems a lot of work? Yes, it is. An IT managed service provider will handle patching for all software, hardware, and network devices. This team will utilize software to automate this task outside of working hours. Patch management is critical to each business's security. You can feel assured that your managed services provider knows and is actively updating your company systems when new patches become available.

### IT Consulting

IT managed service providers offer consulting to understand your company's technology needs better. Typically, these service packages include advice on selecting suitable hardware, general suggestions for enhancing security, and other related support.

### IT Projects![Your IT managed service provider must be involved in your IT projects](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/two-personnel-planning-300x200.webp)

Your [IT managed service provider](https://downtoearthtech.net/managed-it-consulting-services-and-support/) must be involved in your IT projects. They are familiar with your IT infrastructure and your business goals, which allows them to bring their expertise and craft solutions that work best for your business. The MSP can make recommendations, order hardware/software, and install and manage the technology long-term, bringing your company a true white glove experience.

### Network Security

It's crucial to ensure your sensitive information stays safe. If it still needs to be a priority, it needs to be. Returning to business as usual can be easy, with no lasting impact if your data is lost or stolen. An MSP will help build a network security strategy that keeps confidential information inside your network and cyber criminals out.

### Disaster Recovery

If there's a disaster, natural or artificial, it's important to be prepared. Your managed service provider (MSP) will assist your company in creating a backup and recovery (BDR) strategy that ensures your business stays compliant and rebounds swiftly from any setback it encounters.

### Servers

Your MSP helps you set up a server that best meets your business needs. Your managed IT service provider, whether at your office, offsite, or using cloud solutions, has the skills to guide your company's decisions and implement them effectively.

### Training

If your company adopts new software or procedures, a Managed Service Provider (MSP) can educate your employees on how these operate. This approach reduces confusion, ensuring your team comprehensively understands the new solution. Consider the cloud, for example. "78% of executives noted their teams lack the necessary cloud skills for their long-term goals." Your IT managed service provider will assist in training your staff to guarantee everyone comprehends and effectively utilizes the cloud for your company's benefit.

## Why Managed Services?

Sounds great! But how does it benefit you, a new business struggling to keep up with essential IT assistance? In short, many adaptable options fit nicely into your company's infrastructure strategy. Often, IT managed service providers look to create affordable, proactive roadmaps that can fill in the gaps of support, whatever that is. The solution options are too numerous to cover completely here, but we will highlight some of the significant advantages found through a managed service provider.

### Professional Resources

An MSP uses extensive IT knowledge across various areas of technology. This allows cybersecurity specialists, for example, to apply specific solutions to your risk management issues.

These experts manage many clients, each with unique needs and situations. So, partnering with an MSP team gives you access to experienced professionals and sharp intellects, which can be rare to find locally.

### Optimized Technology

Due to regulations and to ensure optimal performance, managed providers typically offer the most advanced hardware and software resources. Do you require access to the newest Office suite? A cloud MSP can provide virtualized services to give you a competitive advantage. Are you concerned about staying on top of security updates or online vendor regulations? By nature of what they do, your provider stays on top of this.

### Flexible Pricing

An MSP should work within the layers of your budget. Some offer a flexible, service-based plan that charges the user a flat fee. IT can be costly if not managed properly, so staying within budget is crucial. Certain services come with long contracts that bind you.

### Cost Savings

Speaking of capital, using an MSP saves financial resources. You can cut down on significant IT costs in all departments without the need to train new employees, purchase expensive new software and hardware, and offload critical tasks to a third party.

### Downtime Reduction and Recovery

Businesses aim to avoid downtime, so reducing it is crucial. Managed Service Providers (MSPs) offer backup options to safeguard important data and can help maintain services during emergencies (such as a cyberattack or severe weather). Given downtime's significant impact, this support is invaluable for smaller businesses. Do you want to learn more about IT managed services? Please reach out to us today!
