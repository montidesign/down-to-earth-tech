In its broadest sense, remote access server support refers to any technical assistance provided to individuals or businesses supporting remote access servers. It usually focuses on assisting a user in troubleshooting a specific problem. 

A remote access server support team frequently needs sensitive access to the user's (or organization's) network or device to provide this assistance. This means proper security controls must be in place, such as privileged access controls, password management, remote access security, session management, and so on.

These will allow the remote access server support team to execute their jobs securely and productively without exposing themselves to security risks, increasing threat vectors, or putting themselves in danger.

## What Does Remote Access Server Mean?

A [remote access server](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/remote_access_server) (RAS) is like a special server that offers various services to users connected to it from a distance through a network or the Internet. It acts as a gateway or main server that links remote users to an organization's internal local area network (LAN).

A RAS includes specialized server software utilized for remote connectivity. This software connects users with connectivity, authentication, and resource access services.

A RAS is used within an organization and is directly connected with the organization's internal network and systems. Once connected with a RAS, users can access their data, desktop, application, print, and other supported services.

## Challenges Faced by RAS

RAS may be an indispensable tech tool that streamlines many business operations, but it also has its own share of challenges that need the help of a reputable remote access server support team.

### Connection Quality

The remote desktop connection will be slow if you have a bad internet connection or weak Wi-Fi signals, like what you often get in hotels or public hotspots. This makes it difficult to access applications or files.

VPNs, which stand for virtual private networks, are quite delicate. It's challenging to work when using them on public internet connections because many of these connections need to allow remote connections, making it almost impossible.

### Performance

Many low-cost methods must have the speed necessary for accomplishing work hours. These solutions may cause delays and are best for small tasks or little work. Also, they might need help accessing local files and printers. Security is a concern in public hotspots like airports, coffee shops, hotels, and public parks. Although convenient, they are vulnerable to hackers who can access your data when you use the shared Wi-Fi.

### Application Availability

Some RAS systems only allow access to certain programs the IT administrator configures. Often, users need access to applications they installed themselves, special plugins, configurations, files from their desktop, or other resources that aren't on the remote access server. These systems usually work differently compared to desktops. This chronic process change is inconvenient and can surely slow any user down.

### Open Applications

Users who leave files or applications open on their business desktops are locked. Logging in to them another time from a remote access system can be challenging.

### HQ Must Be Online

If a natural disaster takes down the internet or power at your business, or worse, the server crashes, and the systems are not accessible locally or remotely. Instead, a business continuity system has to be implemented, which is an additional cost in both resources and money to the company.

Remote access is a technology intended to make employees' lives easier. Still, with the challenges mentioned above, it's difficult not to see the irony given by such a solution: remote access is packed with inherent problems that are not easily resolved. 

This is where a remote access server support team comes in. These [IT consultants](https://downtoearthtech.net/it-consultants/) can help troubleshoot the system and provide any necessary assistance to the company using RAS.

## Why Should You Work with a Remote Access Server Support Team?

From a business perspective, you will spend less time managing employee schedules and focusing more on growing your business. Working with a remote access server support team is an efficient method to troubleshoot issues and resolve them without disrupting operations.

### 4. Reduce Employee Turnover

### 5. Better Knowledge Sharing

In conventional IT support verticals, the technician will restore the system independently. With remote support services, users can resolve issues with consistent guidance from IT experts.

This approach helps improve the staff's knowledge to maintain or restore operations. Routine engagement with IT experts can also help boost employees' technical expertise.

### 6. Remote Access to Cutting-Edge Technologies

Sometimes businesses can work in a bubble and be oblivious to the latest technologies. They may need to gain the necessary resources or knowledge to use advanced technologies.

However, with a remote access server support team, businesses receive expert recommendations and advice on new applications worth considering (there are times with discounted access).

### 7. Grow Your Company Without Fear

## How to Protect Yourself With Remote Access

Remote computer access is risky, but you can't entirely ignore it. No matter your industry, you might have to use it someday.

So, what can you do to protect yourself from the associated risks of remote access? Below are some tips:

Use a VPN: To keep yourself safe, you can use a VPN. It secures the link between your device and the faraway server, making it hard for hackers to get into or steal your information.

Install Security Updates: Ensure your system and the remote server have the latest updates and patches. This ensures any possible security vulnerabilities that hackers might use are closed.

Do not Use Public Wi-Fi: It's not a good idea to connect to remote servers using public Wi-Fi. Public Wi-Fi is not safe and can be easily hacked. If you need to use public Wi-Fi, make sure to use a VPN simultaneously.

Use Strong Passwords: Creating strong passwords for your accounts and system is essential. It prevents hackers from getting into your account, even if they can remotely access your computer. Always use a unique password for each account and regularly change them, especially on devices not connected to any remote access network.
