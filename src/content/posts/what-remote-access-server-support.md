When you experience any tech or IT issues, it may be quite challenging to describe it to a technician accurately. Remote access server support services utilize user behavior, desktop environment, and other application flukes to diagnose computer issues quickly and effectively.

These applications can also streamline user interfaces to allow remote access server support teams to gain access to networks and remote machines. They can also initiate impromptu invites for a quick diagnosis, as well as shortcuts developed to allow external diagnostic tools.

## Technical Troubleshooting

Many companies have utilized desktop sharing applications for a long time. Because of the popularity of these applications in the IT industry, specialized programs were also developed to support technical troubleshooting.

These capabilities and features differentiate remote access server support services from those primarily used for remote working and off-site meetings. However, there are still some similarities in the software used by the two functions.

## Do I Need Remote Access Control?

Nowadays, more and more employees are adopting a more flexible schedule to achieve a work-life balance. Remote access server support services allow this to happen. Companies can leverage remote access server control capabilities to let their employees work remotely – while still accessing their business network.

![Does your business need remote access control?](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/remote-access-support.jpg)Security is an important consideration when delivering remote access server support. When a user connects to an organization’s [server or network](https://downtoearthtech.net/what-is-microsoft-virtual-server/), they are gaining access to pertinent business data and information.

## Methods Used in Remote Access Control

#### Direct or Physical Line

This is a primary remote access control feature that is readily implanted – a company’s LAN directly connecting to a computer. The same direct or physical line can also be utilized to connect to a company LAN as well as a home LAN.

This type of remote access control offers faster connectivity and speed. However, it is more costly and may require regular maintenance because of the use of hardware.

![](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/Bill-Garner-300x181.jpg)Some limitations of this type of method are:

 	- Routing line – routing limitations are due to the kind of structure and the rooting of a computer to router to the hub. It will also most likely require passage through streets, buildings, or other non-controlled areas.

 	- Expense – this is an expensive option because of the needed hardware, cables, and wiring to establish and maintain connectivity.

 	- Insecure – this is not as secure as the other methods. It’s because there are chances of interaction or interruption in the hardware or cable without the knowledge of the user.

 	- Failure risks – this method is prone to failure. It’s because the likelihood of damage from external conditions – whether it’s human interaction, pests, construction work, or whether – to the hardware or cable is high.

#### Virtual Private Network

Establishing a Virtual Private Network is another standard remote access method. This type of network uses the internet to connect users to distant sites. It uses encryption and other tunneling methods to gain access to a business network.

![](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/Alexis-P.-300x236.png)This type of remote access server support method is more suitable for smaller organizations. However, some of the limitations include:

 	- Challenging configurations – this type of connection requires separate settings and individual accounts for each user. If you have a smaller organization, this method is ideal. However, it’s not as apt for bigger companies with several employees.

 	- Restrictions on operating systems – the software you’re using will dictate what type of operating system you need.

 	- Additional software – to get secure connections, you’ll need other software to initiate contact.

## Other Remote Access Methods

The other methods used to initiate access control are using a wireless network (WAN), using an integrated service digital network (ISDN), using a cable modem, or using a [digital subscriber line](https://www.fcc.gov/general/types-broadband-connections) (DSL).

![Remote access server must be secure.](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/secured-network.jpg)These different types of methods have their own pros and cons. To know if it’s the right method for your business operations, consult with an experienced remote access server support team.

Some limitations of these other methods are physical connection restrictions for DSL, additional software needed to establish connection for WAN, and speed limitations for ISDN.
