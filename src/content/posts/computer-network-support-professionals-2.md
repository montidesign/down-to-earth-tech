Do your supervisors and trainers handle computer setups for new employees? A network support specialist can do this for your staff quickly and efficiently.

## What to Look for in Computer Network Support Professionals





Outsourcing is the best way work with computer network support professionals at a price most businesses can afford. If you’re looking for outsourced computer network support professionals, here are six things to consider.





### 1. Level of Expertise





One of the best benefits of outsourcing network support is the ability to leverage a broader base of expertise. Instead of hiring a couple of IT professionals directly for your company, outsourcing lets you access the expertise of an entire agency.





Before hiring, find out how long the agency has been providing computer network support professionals as a service to other companies. You’ll also want to find out how long the specialists assigned to your account have been working in IT so you can assess their background and whether they have the expertise and certifications you’re looking for.





### 2. Scope of Service





Whenever you outsource your computer network support specialists, the service provider will give you a service-level agreement package that outlines the scope of their service. You’ll want to review this carefully to ensure all required IT support aspects are included with your service package.





Consider the availability of support, including 24/7 support across phone, live chat, and other channels, any IT training your company’s employees might require, security surveillance expectations, hardware replacement procedures, and anything else you deem important to your business.





### 3. Ability to Provide Remote Service





Most computer network support professionals provide remote services to clients. You’ll want to verify this is available for your company and how the services are restricted, if at all.





Even if the service provider is local to your area, the ability to provide remote support allows outsourced IT personnel to provide faster service by logging onto your servers and applications wherever you are. Not having to wait for a technician to arrive onsite increases uptime and saves money.





### 4. Ability to Implement New Tech Solutions





When you outsource computer network support professionals, you want to work with experts who can guide you in adopting new, best-in-class technology that will support your business operations.




![Computer network support professionals should be able to provide new tech solutions. ](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/network-support-professionals-300x200.jpg)




In-house IT professionals can also do this, but they’re frequently so overwhelmed with current IT demands that they struggle to consistently research the latest and greatest technologies to hit the market. This is one of outsourced IT’s areas of expertise: They can guide you toward new technologies that improve business operations, increase efficiency and productivity, and optimize your IT spending.





### 5. Additional Licensing Costs





When you’re offered a service package from an outsourced network support vendor, it may or may not include the cost for certain software licenses your business will need to pay to maintain its regular operations.





A few companies will offer a flat fee for services and then charge you individually for additional software licenses they must purchase on your behalf. At the same time, others build this cost directly into your service package. Either way, you’ll want to know whether you can expect software licensing fees in addition to the service cost, as this will affect the overall price.





### 6. Overall Cost Savings





For most businesses, outsourcing computer network support professionals is an easy way to increase services and performance while saving money compared to what they’d pay by hiring their staff. But before you sign on the dotted line, you should look at the total costs you’re facing and determine what kind of savings you’re getting.





It would be best if you also compared this cost with the cost of other IT support providers. Seek out multiple quotes for service to ensure that whatever price you pay is fair.
