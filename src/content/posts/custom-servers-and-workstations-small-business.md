Choosing custom servers and workstations for any business – no matter the scale – can be challenging. For [small business owners](https://downtoearthtech.net/7-types-it-support-for-small-business-owners/), it can get particularly complicated.

With a multitude of server types, hard drives, processors, and many different options to select from, as a business owner, you may feel hopeless to even think about where to begin your search.

Fortunately, selecting custom servers and workstations for your small business doesn’t have to be a dreadful process. In today’s post, we’ll look through some helpful tips in choosing custom servers and workstations.

## Servers and Workstations: Main Differences

First, let’s talk about the [difference between a server and a workstation](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-server-work-station-71396.html). Used for RAM and CPU programs and other applications such as video editing, graphic design, etc., a workstation serves as a personal computer. It consists of RAM, processor, and hard drives.

It's typically a computer system that hosts multiple applications available for remote users to access via the internet.

## How Custom Servers and Workstations Help Small and Midsized Business (SMB)

Custom servers and workstations are a massive help for small and midsized business operations. Here are some of the important functions of servers and workstations:

 	- Email hosting

 	- Website or e-Commerce store hosting

 	- Software as a Service (SaaS) apps hosting for invoice management, employee management, customer service management, planning software, project management, and collaboration software, etc.

 	- Back-up

 	- Documents storage

 	- [Remote desktops](https://downtoearthtech.net/what-remote-access-server-support/) for remote employees

SMB servers can provide these functions – and more. Custom servers and workstations built to deliver these functions simultaneously are ideal to get.

## ![](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/Alexis-P.-300x236.png)Do I Need Custom Servers and Workstations for My Small Business?

The short answer is yes, you do. If your business is thriving, or if you want your business to grow and succeed, a dedicated server is a vital tool to acquire. Here are the signs that it’s time to get a custom server for your business.

### Business is Growing

When you started your business, it was just probably you doing everything. Then you grew to two employees helping you with daily business functions. All of a sudden, you have four, six, or ten in your team with their own tasks and responsibilities.

While hiring more people means your company is starting to experience growth, it’s more challenging to manage your growing team’s computer needs – especially if your employees work remotely, which is a standard setup nowadays.

![](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/Bill-Garner-300x181.jpg)When working with a team, there’s nothing more upsetting than starting work on an outdated file, spreadsheet, or document. It would be best if you had your own server to serve as the central repository for all business resources that your team needs to share and access.

### Secure Email and File Storage

Having cloud storage offers many benefits. However, no matter what cloud storage provider you choose to get, you’re relinquishing direct control on your data and resources.

With security breach horror stories – even on big corporations such as Facebook or Sony – getting a dedicated company server can give you the peace of mind you need. With your own company server, your important data and business resources can reside on a server that you can fully control and access.

Cloud storage fees also skyrocket as your team members grow. It may have been logical when you only had two or three staff. However, email and cloud functions will soon be a monthly expenditure that eats into your operating costs. Custom servers and workstations for small businesses can address security, control, and expense issues.

### Consistent and Fast Access to Your Business Data

![Point of Sale (POS) systems work better on a dedicated company server.](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/point-of-sale.jpg)Businesses rely on multiple types of equipment to access and control their data.

Other requirements, such as a point-of-sale system, are also essential. A dedicated server provides hosting and database functions for small and midsized businesses.

If you’re in the video productions business or you’re a video content creator, having your own dedicated server is a no-brainer. Video files – especially 4K ones – are often massive, needing a large storage house.

Unpredictable and unreliable network connection makes managing video files incredibly upsetting and impossible. Custom servers and workstations are built to meet your specifications – whatever your hard drive capacity, RAM, or CPU requirements are.
