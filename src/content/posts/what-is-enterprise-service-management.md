Enterprise service management (ESM) brings service delivery across departments into one shared system. This enterprise service management definition is simple: it uses the same service management approach IT uses, but for the whole business. Later in this guide, you’ll see the enterprise service management definition applied to real use cases.


Companies often ask, “what is enterprise service management” when they want smoother internal service. If you’re also wondering what is enterprise service management, this guide breaks it down fast.





## What is Enterprise Service Management?





![What is enterprise service management?](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/What-is-Enterprise-Service-Management-All-About-300x200.jpg)At its core, what is enterprise service management? It is a way to manage service requests across every department using one platform. In other words, what is enterprise service management doing for you? It standardizes intake, routing, and tracking so work moves faster.







With such purposes in mind, case management with SLA and workflow automation become the primary characteristics of ESM to ensure that the end-to-end service lifecycle is executed thoroughly and can be traced by not only the fulfillers but also all other involved parties.







## How ESM Helps Your Business
