## Common Cyber Threats Targeting Small Businesses


### Phishing Attacks


![Hooded cybersecurity specialist works at desktop computer, defending companies through advanced it support services tonight](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/Cybersecurity-Analyst-Monitoring.webp)Phishing emails trick employees into sharing passwords or clicking dangerous links. The FBI received over 193,000 phishing complaints in 2024, with losses exceeding $70 million according to ConnectWise.


One in every 323 emails sent to small firms is malicious, StrongDM reports. A single successful phishing attack can lead to stolen credentials, malware infections, and fraudulent money transfers.



### Ransomware


Ransomware encrypts your files and demands payment to unlock them. Nearly 47% of small businesses were hit by ransomware in the past year, according to ConnectWise.


Operations stop completely. About 51% of small business victims end up paying the ransom, StrongDM found. Even then, full recovery isn't guaranteed.



### Malware and Network Breaches


Other malware like viruses and spyware constantly threaten business systems. Malware was the most common attack type against small businesses at 18%, closely followed by phishing at 17%, per StrongDM.


Many attacks succeed because systems lack updates or basic firewalls. Without dedicated IT staff, these threats can go unnoticed for months.



### Weak Passwords and Human Error


A study found that 80% of hacking incidents involve stolen or weak credentials, StrongDM reports. Yet only 20% of small businesses use multi-factor authentication.


Employees at small firms face 350% more social engineering attacks than those at larger companies according to StrongDM. Common mistakes include reusing simple passwords and clicking malicious links.


Why attack small businesses? They hold valuable data but lack strong defenses. About 87% store customer financial information that hackers want to steal, StrongDM notes.



## How IT Support Services Protect Your Business


![Infographic explains ways small businesses use it support services for monitoring, backups, training, and consulting](https://downtoearthtech.net/media/Cybersecurity-Services-Infographic.webp)Professional [it support services](https://downtoearthtech.net/managed-it-consulting-services-and-support/) give small companies enterprise-level protection without the enterprise cost. Here's how small business it support teams defend against cyber threats.



### 24/7 Security Monitoring


Managed IT providers watch your networks and devices around the clock. This matters because 76% of ransomware infections strike outside normal working hours, MicroAge reports.


With continuous monitoring, it support services catch threats immediately and respond before major damage occurs. A Security Operations Center can contain incidents within minutes of detection.



### Proactive Updates and Patch Management


IT teams keep all your systems updated with the latest security patches. Many breaches happen because of outdated software that hackers know how to exploit.


About 58% of small businesses now use antivirus software and 49% use network firewalls, StrongDM data shows. Managed IT consulting Waco providers set up and monitor these tools for you, creating strong barriers against attacks.



### Data Backup and Disaster Recovery


Reliable backups are crucial for cyber resilience. IT providers implement automated backup solutions, often using both onsite and cloud storage.


If ransomware strikes, recent backups let you restore files instead of paying ransoms. Nearly 40% of small businesses lost crucial data after cyberattacks, according to StrongDM.



### Employee Security Training


Quality small business it support includes cybersecurity awareness training for your staff. Training teaches employees to recognize phishing emails, create strong passwords, and use multi-factor authentication.


The SBA states that "no better line of defense against cybercrime than well-informed employees" exists. Trained staff become your "human firewall" who avoid common traps.



### Strategic IT Consulting


Managed it consulting Waco services help you plan long-term security. This includes conducting risk assessments, selecting the right security tools, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
