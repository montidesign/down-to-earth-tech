						<h3 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-white mb-4 text-2xl tracking-[-1px]">Keep Your Data Safe</h3>
						<div class="space-y-4 text-white text-xl font-cuprum leading-relaxed">
							<p>Your network, databases, client information, and digital data must all be stored somewhere. With "cloud storage," you're trusting your business information to be securely stored on someone else's server. Those servers can be located in other countries, and your data is sent on trips around the world, hundreds of times each day, through hundreds of access points with thousands of users.</p>
							<p>With secure Dell, HP, or Lenovo workstations and protected HP, Lenovo, and Dell servers of your own, you control your business data. It never has to travel or be exposed to threats.</p>
						</div>

					<div>
						<h3 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-white mb-4 text-2xl tracking-[-1px]">Faster Results</h3>
						<p class="text-white text-xl font-cuprum leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Your business computers run more quickly when their information is organized and stored well, with regular maintenance and backups. That's simply fact. Everyone who uses a computer at your business, visits your website, or sends you an electronic payment is a part of your network and is affected by your server speed. When slow or inaccessible servers makes data retrieval difficult, it can slow your entire workflow.
						</p>
						<p class="text-white text-xl font-cuprum leading-relaxed">
							Down to Earth Technology will install and maintain your business' HP, Dell, or Lenovo servers to make sure everyone in your network is always wowed by your speed.
