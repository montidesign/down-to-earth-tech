					<p>No matter your business industry, network security is one of your top concerns. You may have only one secure network with one access point, for a few employees, or you may have several secure networks that spread over many office locations. Whatever your business' situation, you need to know that your computers and their wireless networks are protected.</p>
					<p>When your computer network isn't safe, it's possible your business' documents and records aren't safe. It could be that your business finances become vulnerable. Wireless network security affects your business on every level – from customers to investors – with every business having different needs.</p>
					<p>Down to Earth Technology computer network support specialists provide services to protect your computers and network from attacks, including installing and monitoring:</p>
					<ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
						<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encoding data and information to prevent outsiders from reading your documents, statements, and records</li>
						<li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Password-protected barriers that stop outsiders from making changes to your computer network</li>

					<p>Your secure business IT network must be kept solid.</p>
